# Beautiful-Split-Overlay-Line-Border-Menu - Responsive

Overlay menus are a fairly common concept in mobile web design, where the screen space is limited. They allow you to show new content on top of other content. Overlays are very similar to links, except they have a transparent background and appear on top of the original page. This style can also be used in designs intended for bigger screens, creating a new interacting experience for the user and decluttering the information displayed.
